## what I used?

I used the React.js framework and Material UI. I used the Apex Chart for the chart. I used the React-Router for the routing. I used Jest for the testing. I used the React-Scripts for the development. The important thing is having organized folders and files for other developers. I used Iconify for the icons. I used Simple-Chat-Bot for the chatbot. To provide form validation, I used Yup and Yup resolver. https://github.com/jquense/yup  To create fake data, I used faker js. I used Axios library and your API link to create the dictionary part.
